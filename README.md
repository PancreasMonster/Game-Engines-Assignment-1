# Game-Engines-Assignment-1
This assignment will aim to develop a rollercoaster ride that has audio reactive moments with some procedural generation.
## Introduction 
This assignment will feature a ride (with minimal intereaction) following a track. It will feature some audio reactive elements (for example, the ride's speed matching the tempo) and procedural generation, such as the track being created by perlin noise.

## The Main Aims 
To create a fun, energetic audiovisual experience. I may add some interation such as dodging obstacles, which is present the game "Audiosurf", present in Fig. 1 above. If possible, I would like the map's track to match the song used. Ultimately, I want a lot of audio reactive, visual effects such as trails, particles and animations to put the user into a flowstate as they listen. 

## The Challenges Ahead
