# Submission ReadME

## Introduction 
This assignment ultimately turned out to be a procedurally generated roller coaster with audio reactive elements, customisable effects and fancy effects. The track is randomly generated in real time as previous sections are destroyed, and you can change the radius of loops and the number of cork screws as it runs. All pieces slot into each other as it's made. I took the audio reactive elements from class and the waypoint movement from a tutorial, but the rest was made from previous knowledge.

## What I'm most proud of
In this assignment, I am most proud of the colourful aestethic present throughout the ride. In my opinion, this is accomplished through the inverted sky sphere, the interlocking parts of the rollercoaster and the segments of the rollercoaster moving to the music's beat.

## Instructions
To run, just download and play, as all settings are preselected. The MasterController object in the hierarchy can be used to customise each section of the rollercoaster, while the rollercoaster's speed can be changed by changing the speed variable on the Coaster object. Press 'R' to change the spin of the sky sphere and 'Space' to change the spin of the coaster.
